Level Ground fully responsive website

This was my version of the Level Ground website I intended to make it mobile responsive.

Demo:

How it's made:

Tech Used:
HTML, and CSS.

I took the original design and wanted to make something as close to the original as possible. First I started off by creating a wireframe and from there I added in the content, After the content was in there I added in the colors and fontawesome icons, Once everything looked good I work on making it mobile responsive.

Optimizations:
I wasn't able to do it upon first try but I would like to go back and create a hamburger menu for the mobile responsive version of this website.

Lessons Learned:
This was one of my first attempts at creating a mobile responsive website. Before this I was just making sites that would work on computers but i've come to learn how important making websites that are viewable in all sizes have become.

Examples:
Take a look at some other work I have in my portfolio:
